implementation
	function separation
		- functionalities which are used in more that two places must be functions.
		- functionalities which are used only in single place : is logic specific ? no function : function
	
nameing
	file
		- file name must only contain small letter, number, '_', and '.'
		- each words are separated by '_'.
		- every class which have logic but not inside another class should have it's own .h or .cpp file
	type
		- user types must start with cappital letter.
		- each words are separated by capital letter of following word.
			- use '_' when necessary.
	variable
		- local variable : starts with small case, separate words with cappital
		- member variable : put '_' at the end
		- parameter variable : put '_' at the front

namespace
	naming
		- same as file name
	depth
		- math filter & file & namespace sturcture
	memo
		- idk if i should keep nested namespace dpeth since it's inconvenient to use
		- the purpose of namespace is to
			1. avoid conflict with other project
			2. avoid conflict name other contexts in the same project (+ be bore explicit)
