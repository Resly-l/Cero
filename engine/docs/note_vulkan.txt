classes having Vk~ types as members and destroying Vk~ objects in destructor
must consider implementation of copy constructor

there is no guarantee that command buffers will be executed in the order they have been submitted by the application
framebuffer object references all of the VkImageView objects that represent the attachments
Subpasses are subsequent rendering operations that depend on the contents of framebuffers in previous passes

renderpass specifies how many attachments there will be during gfx operation and how their layout, sampler state set

framebuffers are dependent on renderpasses (= create info takes renderpass)
the thing is, swapchain images have framebuffers individually meaning in each every frame, different framebuffer must be bound.

- framebuffer is render target
- ?? is it possible to pair n framebuffers with 1 renderpass ??
	- if so, make single pipeline with multiple render targets -> guesssing it has to be possible
- pipeline cannot own framebuffers ? -> re-think
- if pipeline owns renderpass, then framebuffer(render target) must be made depending on the pipeline
	-> but then again, regardless of vulkan, pipeline must know how input&output attachments are configured which is
		 exactly what vulkan renderpass is for. meaning it's neccessary

framebuffer is just a buffer which holds render target information
it can specify how each render targets will be used during redering that frame
image used by framebuffer is the actual render target

pipeline knows shader layout
	-> shader knows number of attachments and thier layouts
		-> pipline has render targets
			-> how do we draw to a render target which was not created by pipline
			render target = image & framebuffer can be composed when we decide which pipeline will be drawing to which render target

shader pair 1 : pipeline 1 : renderpass 1 : framebuffer n
framebuffer 1 : attachments(render target) n

1 pipline -> 3 swap chain images -> 3 framebuffers with each different attachments

synchronization
	semaphore
		semaphore is used to add order between queue operations
		are used both to order work inside the same queue and between different queues

	fences
		fences must be reset manually to put them back into the unsignaled state
		they block cpu

	In summary, semaphores are used to specify the execution order of operations on the GPU while fences are used to keep the CPU and GPU in sync with each-other.

	why would i need render target interface
	- to bind pipline and render target separatly
